# 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ Customer Segmentation in Python

Prodigy Infotech Machine Learning Task 2

This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques on a mall customer dataset. It aims to group customers based on key features such as income and spending behavior to help businesses target specific customer segments more effectively.

</br>

### Problem Statement
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

</br>

### 📊 Dataset

Source: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data)

The dataset contains information on 200 mall customers, including:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

</br>

### 🚀 How to Run 
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SafalNarsingh/Prodigy_ML_02
```
2. Install dependencies:
 ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn 
 ```
3. Launch jupyternotebook:
 ```
jupyter notebook customers.ipynb
 ```

 </br>

### 📦 Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

</br>


### 🔧 Features

- Visual analysis using histograms, boxplots, and pairplots
- Encoding of categorical variables (Gender)
